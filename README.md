# EduNeuroSense: EEG-Based Educational Management for Social Well-being

## Overview
**EduNeuroSense** is an innovative framework that leverages EEG signal analysis to predict and mitigate social isolation and loneliness among students. By integrating EEG-based behavioral analytics into a **Strategic Educational Management Network (SEMN)**, this project aims to provide real-time, data-driven insights to enhance student well-being and optimize institutional strategies.  

## Background  
Social isolation and loneliness significantly impact students' academic performance and mental health. Traditional approaches rely on surveys and observations, which lack real-time objectivity and predictive capabilities. EduNeuroSense addresses these limitations by using EEG-based analytics to monitor neural indicators of social engagement and stress, ensuring timely interventions and effective support mechanisms.

## Key Features
- **EEG Signal Analysis**: Captures neural correlates related to social engagement, stress, and emotional well-being.
- **Strategic Educational Management Network (SEMN)**: Optimizes institutional strategies and resource allocation.
- **Real-time Behavioral Insights**: Generates dynamic learner profiles to personalize interventions.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Enhances early detection accuracy compared to traditional assessment methods.
- **Experimental Validation**: Demonstrates improved engagement metrics and intervention efficacy.

## Methodology
1. **EEG Data Collection**: Acquire EEG signals from students in different social contexts.
2. **Signal Processing & Feature Extraction**: Identify neural patterns associated with loneliness and social interactions.
3. **Machine Learning Models**: Train predictive models for early detection of social isolation.
4. **SEMN Integration**: Incorporate insights into educational management systems.
5. **Intervention & Evaluation**: Implement personalized support strategies and measure their impact.
